# Grocery-Store-Management-A-MySql-Project
- Here is a clean, polished GitHub README titled exactly as you requested: Grocery-Store-Management.
- Fully structured, professional, and ready to paste into GitHub.
## Grocery-Store-Management
- A complete SQL-based management system designed for handling grocery store operations, including suppliers, products, customers, employees, orders, and sales analytics.

- This project includes:
-  Database design
- able creation with relationships
- Data manipulation
- 30+ analytical SQL queries for insights
## 📌 Project Overview
- The Grocery-Store-Management system simulates a real-world grocery store using a relational database.
- It allows store administrators to:
- Manage suppliers & product categories
- Track customers and employees
- Record orders and their details
- Analyze sales, revenue, and product performance
This project demonstrates strong SQL skills in database design, joins, grouping, aggregations, constraints, and trend analysis.
## 🗂️ Database Schema Structure
- The system is built using 7 relational tables:
- Table Name	Purpose
- supplier	Stores supplier information
- categories	Stores grocery product categories
- employees	Employee records
- customers	Customer details
- products	Product list linked to suppliers & categories
- orders	Customer purchase orders
- order_details	Item-level order information
## 🛠️ Tools & Skills I Used
- MySQL Workbench – for database creation, query execution, and schema design
- XAMPP / phpMyAdmin (optional) – for running MySQL locally
- SQL Server / Local MySQL Environment – to manage and test the database
- VS Code / Notepad++ – for writing and editing SQL scripts.
## Key Insights I Found (Short Version)
- The store has strong repeat customers, with a few contributing the highest revenue.
- Certain products and categories dominate sales, becoming key revenue drivers.
- Monthly and daily trends show clear patterns in customer buying behavior.
- Some suppliers contribute significantly more products and revenue than others.
- Employee performance varies, with a few handling most of the orders and sales.
- Higher order quantities directly increase total order value, confirming expected purchase patterns.
## How to Run
## 1.Download or clone the repository
- git clone <your-repo-link>
## 2.Open MySQL Workbench / XAMPP / phpMyAdmin
- Make sure MySQL Server is running.
## 3.Import the SQL file
- Open Grocery_Store_Management.sql
- Run the entire script to create tables and relationships.
## 4.Insert sample data (if included)
- Run the INSERT queries if your file has them.
- Run the analysis queries
## 5.Copy and execute any of the analysis queries to view insights such as:
- Top customers
- Product performance
- Monthly sales trends
## Supplier and employee analysis
- View results
- MySQL Workbench will show output tables for each query.
##  Conclusion
- The Grocery-Store-Management project successfully demonstrates how a structured SQL database can simplify store operations and provide meaningful business insights. Through well-designed tables, relationships, and analytical queries, the system helps track customers, products, suppliers, employees, and sales performance effectively. This project highlights strong skills in database design, SQL querying, and data-driven decision-making—laying a solid foundation for scalable retail management solutions.
